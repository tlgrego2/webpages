        One of the most distinctive planets in our solar system is <em>Venus</em>, often called Earth's "sister planet" because of its similar size and mass. However, Venus is drastically different due to its extreme surface conditions, with temperatures hot enough to melt lead—around 900°F (475°C)—and atmospheric pressure 90 times that of Earth. Its thick atmosphere is composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a runaway greenhouse effect. Venus also rotates in the opposite direction of most planets, meaning it has a retrograde rotation, and its day (243 Earth days) is longer than its year (225 Earth days). These extreme features make Venus both fascinating and inhospitable.

        Newton's thought experiment for orbiting involves imagining a cannon on a mountain firing a cannonball. If fired slowly, the ball will fall to Earth, but if fired fast enough (about 8 km/s), it will continuously fall towards Earth but never hit it, instead orbiting the planet. This demonstrates the concept of orbit: an object moving fast enough horizontally will keep "falling" around Earth due to its curvature. In orbital mechanics, the <em>periapsis</em> is the closest point in an orbit to the planet, and the <em>apoapsis</em> is the farthest point. A spacecraft moves fastest at periapsis and slowest at apoapsis.
