<!--this is a little about my favorite part of NCSU and something I enjoy there-->
    <p>Hey! My name is Trenton Gregory and my favorite part NCSU is <em>centennial campus</em>. I love all the shade provided by the trees on the streets surrounding <strong>the Oval</strong>, and the very focused architecture around it. I like to walk around and find some of the <em>various types of acorns</em> made by the trees around campus.</p>
